The goal of this project is to create a wholistic solution for
fantasy sports to enable data driven decision making for winning 
Fantasy football leagues. 

The project will contain:

1)Yahoo fantasy bot.
2)Pro-Football reference bot.
3)ESPN bot.
4)MySQL db schemas for storing data.
5)ETL scripts to load the raw downloaded data into the MySQL schema.
6)Statistical packages for making predictions based on the data. Will possibly use rapid miner and R.

Bots will enable the extraction of data to CSV and then the automation of league actions based on data analysis for automatic decision making.
